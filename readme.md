# Daily Coding Problem. I solve them for you. 

Hi! I'm Mario, I have fun to make video on YouTube (_link at the top_) about problem solving and coding skill. Daily Coding Problem is a program described by these words: 
"Get _exceptionally_ good at coding interviews by solving one problem every day."


## I solve the problem

I solve the problem using one of the most important programming language, like C, or C++, or Java, and I publish the solution to GitHub, check my personal profile to see all the solutions. 

## I make a video-explanation

After I make a video-explanation about the solution I proposed before on my GitHub's personal profile, or LinkedIn or on my Facebook page.
